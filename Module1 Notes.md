My first attempts to create a 3D scan were fairly successful in the sense that I got the gyst of it. I scanned a few toy cars I had laying around and some dog toys as well. It did not go well because Trnio was pulling the background into the model and melting them together. 
My second attempt was a traditional knife which has the head of a horse as its hilt, this was difficult to scan because I had no stand for the knife so I stopped trying to get it to work. 
I was thinking of going back to the toy cars and putting up a white background to try and get the app to only focus on the objects, but after our entry ticket exercise on Jan.31 I spoke with Scott who was also using the Trnio app and he told me that it does not work well with a white background which saved me the time of trying it out myself. He also told me how to export my model to Sketchfab which was extremely helpful
For my final model I found a bust of Saint Thomas Aquinas in the University of Ottawa and so I asked a friend of mine to show me where it was and I managed to scan it and get a decent model out of it. The only issues I had with that were the weird looks I got from other students who did not find the bust as interesting as I did.
